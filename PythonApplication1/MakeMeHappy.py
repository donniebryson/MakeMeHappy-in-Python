# This is as simple a Python script as possible. 
# It seeks to fulfill the same user story as the Machine Learning for Kids worksheet
# 'Make me happy' which is written in Scratch. 

# It assumes that a class has already completed the project in Scratch on the
# website: https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/worksheets 
# If the Scratch version of the worksheet is complete, then the student has a workspace_id, username, and password for Watson.
# The student also has their model created and tested. These are needed for this script to work.

# The file, example_config_file.txt, must be edited to include your actual workspace_id, username, and password and then renamed
# config.json in the same direcory as MakeMeHappy.py.

# Each student will need to execute 'pip install watson_developer_cloud' for the proper Watson library. 

# The code was testing with Python 3.6.

# All credit is given to Dale Lane for the fantastic job he did with Machine Learning for Kids without intangling him in any 
# of my mistakes potentially here. 
# Direct corrections and suggestions for this Python code to: donniebryson@gmail.com
